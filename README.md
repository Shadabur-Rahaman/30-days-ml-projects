# 🧠 30 Days of Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **#30DaysOfML** journey! This repository is a personal challenge to build **30 machine learning projects in 30 days**, covering the most in-demand and relevant topics in the field — from core algorithms to deep learning, NLP, computer vision, explainable AI, and deployment.

Each day includes:
- A unique, hands-on project
- Clean Python code (many from scratch)
- Clear documentation and visualizations
- Real-world datasets
- Links to blog posts and LinkedIn updates
> 🛠️ Projects will be added daily and linked here once completed.

## 🔍 Goals

- Strengthen my ML foundations through consistent practice
- Build an industry-ready portfolio of small-to-mid-size ML projects
- Learn by building: models, tools, dashboards, and APIs
- Share everything openly on GitHub and LinkedIn
